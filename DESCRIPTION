Description: A set of functions that help the analysis and 
  visualization of an ensemble of boolean models for biomarker discovery in 
  cancer cell networks. These functions allow to easily 
  import the data results of the DrugLogics software pipeline for drug combination
  predictions while others (more generic ones) can be used to split a boolean model 
  dataset with regards to the models predictive performance (number of true 
  positive predictions or MCC score) or synergy prediction based on a given set 
  of observed synergies and find the average activity difference per network 
  node between all pairs of splitted model groups. Thus, given user-specific thresholds,
  important nodes (biomarkers) can be accessed in the sense that they make the 
  models predict specific synergies (synergy biomarkers) or have better 
  performance in general (higher MCC, performance biomarkers). Lastly, if the 
  boolean models have a specific equation form and differ only in their link operator, 
  link operator biomarkers can also be assesed.
